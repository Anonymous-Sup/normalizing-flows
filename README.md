# Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch implementation of several normalizing flow, including a variational autoencoder.


## Implemented Flows

* Planar flow ([Rezende & Mohamed, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05770))
* Radial flow ([Rezende & Mohamed, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05770))
